## Project Description 
> A 2 player game. Find the secret word before Spaceman blasts off into space! The first player will submit a word and the second player will guess letters, having the letters appear on screen in the correct places of the secret word. If player 2 guesses all of the letters within a certain margin of incorrect letters, they win the game!

## User Stories
> Add user stories following the _As a [type of user], I want [what the user wants], so that [what it helps accomplish]_ format.
As a user, I want to be able to see the word represented as a bunch of underscores so that I can tell how many letters it is
As a user,  Would like to see which letters I got correctly and have those letters added on to the word to get a better understanding of what the word might be. 
As a user, I would like to be able to enter and set a word to guess in order to set up the game and have the game implement the word  I want 
As a user I would like to see the spaceship to give me a visual cue of how many tries I have left of guessing the correct letters 
As a user I would like to see a box showing me how many tries I have left so that I have another visual cue of how many tries I have left of guessing the correct letters 

### MVP Goals
1) Have a submission box where the player can enter a secret word 
2) have place holders that represent the letters in the secret word 
3) Have the letters appear that were guess correctly in the place holders
4) Add a new part of the space ship when the player guesses an incorrect letter 
5) If the spaceship is built before all of the letters are guessed the game ends
6) If the word is fully guessed, before the space ship is built the game ends
